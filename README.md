# landing-page
This is the landing page project at the end of the Flex Box section in The Odin Project. This project will hopefully pull together the html, css, and flex skills I have studied thus far.

Landing page is complete, and I learned that I knew abolutely nothing about Flex from the lessons, until I actually began trying to build the landing page and put the information into practice. Hands-on learning is still one of the best ways to become proficent in a new skill.
